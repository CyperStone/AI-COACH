### Prototype of application which helps newbies in strength training


## Project Overview
* Gathered and labelled strength training videos of dozens medium advanced gym enthusiasts which were imitating technique errors
* Designed and created a training assistant system which recognizes start/end of the exercise, counts repetitions, and detects errors in exercise techniques (over 80% accuracy for most of the events)
* Deployed the system into an application which signals detected events with visual and audible messages in real-time
